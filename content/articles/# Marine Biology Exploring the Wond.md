## Introduction

Marine biology is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean and other saltwater environments. This diverse field encompasses everything from microscopic plankton to the largest animals on Earth, blue whales, and examines their behaviors, physiology, and interactions with the marine environment.

The oceans cover approximately 71% of the Earth's surface and contain about 97% of the planet's water, making marine biology crucial to understanding global ecosystems. Marine biologists work to uncover the mysteries of ocean life while addressing critical environmental challenges such as climate change, overfishing, and habitat destruction.

## The History of Marine Biology

### Early Exploration

Humans have been studying marine life for thousands of years, with early observations recorded by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE. However, modern marine biology began with the voyages of exploration in the 18th and 19th centuries.

### The Challenger Expedition (1872-1876)

Considered the founding expedition of marine science, HMS Challenger circumnavigated the globe, collecting thousands of biological and physical oceanographic samples. This expedition:

- Discovered over 4,700 new marine species
- Mapped ocean basins and currents
- Established marine biology as a scientific discipline

### 20th Century Advances

The development of SCUBA gear in the 1940s and submersibles in the 1960s allowed direct observation of marine life. Satellite technology in the late 20th century revolutionized our ability to study ocean processes on a global scale.

## Major Marine Ecosystems

### Coral Reefs

Often called the "rainforests of the sea," coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth:

- Cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support about 25% of all marine species
- Built by colonies of coral polyps over thousands of years
- Provide essential ecosystem services including coastal protection and fisheries support

### Deep Sea Ecosystems

The deep ocean (below 200 meters) contains unique ecosystems:

- Hydrothermal vents: Support chemosynthetic communities independent of sunlight
- Abyssal plains: Vast, flat areas with specialized detritus-feeding organisms
- Hadal zone: Life exists even in the deepest trenches (below 6,000 meters)

### Polar Seas

Arctic and Antarctic waters host specially adapted species:

- Krill form the base of polar food webs
- Marine mammals like seals and whales have thick blubber for insulation
- Many fish species produce antifreeze proteins

### Coastal Ecosystems

Important transitional zones between land and sea:

- Estuaries: Nurseries for many marine species
- Mangrove forests: Protect coastlines and sequester carbon
- Kelp forests: Underwater forests that support diverse communities

## Marine Organisms

### Plankton

Microscopic drifters that form the base of marine food webs:

- Phytoplankton: Photosynthetic organisms responsible for about 50% of Earth's oxygen
- Zooplankton: Small animals that feed on phytoplankton

### Marine Invertebrates

Make up the majority of marine biodiversity:

- Cnidarians: Jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones
- Mollusks: Squid, octopuses, clams, and snails
- Echinoderms: Starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers
- Crustaceans: Crabs, lobsters, and shrimp

### Fish

Approximately 33,000 known species of fish inhabit marine environments:

- Cartilaginous fish: Sharks, rays, and skates
- Bony fish: The majority of fish species
- Deep-sea fish: Often bioluminescent with specialized adaptations

### Marine Reptiles

Includes sea turtles, sea snakes, and saltwater crocodiles. Many are threatened by human activities.

### Marine Mammals

Warm-blooded ocean dwellers that breathe air:

- Cetaceans: Whales, dolphins, and porpoises
- Pinnipeds: Seals, sea lions, and walruses
- Sirenians: Manatees and dugongs

### Seabirds

Birds adapted to life at sea, such as albatrosses, penguins, and puffins.
